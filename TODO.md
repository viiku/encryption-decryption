To enhance this project, we can focus on several areas:

###1. Improved encryption algorithms
    Implement more secure algorithms like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).
    Add support for multiple encryption methods, allowing the user to choose.
    Implement a key-based system instead of a simple shift.
###2. Better file handling
    Add support for larger files using buffered reading/writing.
    Implement error handling for file operations.
    Add the ability to encrypt/decrypt entire folders.
###3. User interface improvements
    Create a simple GUI using a library like Qt or wxWidgets.
    Implement a command-line interface with more options.
###4. Additional features
    Add password protection for encrypted files.
    Implement file integrity checks (e.g., using checksums).
    Add compression before encryption to save space and increase security.
